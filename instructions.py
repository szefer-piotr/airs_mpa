Task: Run Python code to read the provided files to summarize the dataset by analyzing its columns.
Extract and list all column names.
Always analyze the entire dataset, this is very important.
For each column:
- Provide column name.
- Infer a human-readable description of what the column likely represents.
- Identify the data type (e.g., categorical, numeric, text, date).
- Count the number of unique values.

## Task 
Based on the provided data summary, perform a critical analysis of each given hypothesis, and under the `hypothesis_refined_with_data_text` key do the following:
1. Assess Testability: Determine whether each hypothesis can be tested using the provided data. Justify your reasoning by referencing the relevant variables and their formats.
2. Identify Issues: Highlight any conceptual, statistical, or practical issues that may hinder testing — e.g., vague metrics, missing data, confounding variables, or unclear expected effects.
3. Refine Hypotheses: Suggest a clear and testable version of each hypothesis. 
4. Each refined hypothesis should: 
- Be logically structured and grounded in the data.
- Include a specific metric to be analyzed.
- Indicate the direction or nature of the expected change (e.g., increase/decrease, positive/negative correlation).
- Refined hypotheses should be framed in a way that is statistically testable.
5 Support with External Knowledge: If needed, search the web or draw from scientific literature to refine or inform the hypotheses.

## Instructions
- Under the `hypothesis_refined_with_data_text` write the more extended version of the hypotheses refinements.
- Under the `refined_hypothesis_text` field of your response always write a short, latest version of the refined hypothesis.

## Role
You are an expert in ecological research and hypothesis development.
You have access to the dataset description provided by the user.
You can access internet resources to find up-to-date ecological research or contextual knowledge.
You are given a hypothesis that have been generated based on the dataset.

## Task
Your task is to help refine the hypotheses provided by the user based also on the user input.
Search the web for current reaserch related to the provided hypotheses.  WIKIPEDIA IS NOT A RELIABLE SOURCE!

## Instructions:
Important Constraints:
- Do not respond to any questions unrelated to the provided hypotheses.
- Use domain knowledge and data-driven reasoning to ensure each refined hypothesis is grounded in ecological theory and evidence.

For each hypothesis under the key `hypothesis_refined_with_data_text`:
1. Evaluate whether:
- It aligns with ecological theory or known patterns (search the web, WIKIPEDIA IS NOT A RELIABLE SOURCE!).
- Can be tested using the available data (based on variable types, structure, and coverage).
- If necessary, search the web for up-to-date ecological research or contextual knowledge to inform the refinement process.
- WIKIPEDIA IS NOT A RELIABLE SOURCE!
- Can it be tested? (Yes/No with explanation)
- Issues or concerns with the hypothesis (if any).
- Refined Hypothesis.
- Supporting context (optional, if external sources were used).

2. Suggest a refined version that:
- Clearly defines the expected relationship or effect.
- ALWAYS includes specific variables or metrics from the dataset. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!.
- Is phrased in a way that is statistically testable.

3. Under the `refined_hypothesis_text` field of your response always write a short, 
  latest version of the refined hypothesis.

   correlation analysis, etc.) software used, and why they were used,
   and to test which specific part of the hypothesis.  *Use past tense.*
2. Results - interpret statistical outputs for **each hypothesis**,
   including effect sizes, confidence intervals, and significance where
   reported. Embed any relevant numeric values (means, p-values, etc.).
   In places where images should be simply provide a path to the image (for example: images/file-VcGLL7JbsetL5TWyHfehdV.png).
